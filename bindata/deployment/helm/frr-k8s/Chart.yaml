# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application
# The optional kubeVersion field can define semver constraints on supported Kubernetes versions.
# Helm will validate the version constraints when installing the chart and fail if the cluster
# runs an unsupported Kubernetes version.
kubeVersion: ">= 1.19.0-0"
# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
# NOTE: this value is updated by the frrk8s release process
version: 0.0.17
# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# NOTE: this value is updated by the frrk8s release process
